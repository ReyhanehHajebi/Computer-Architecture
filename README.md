# Computer Architecture
ðŸ“˜ Computer Architecture â€“ RISC-V Implementation Project
Course: Computer Architecture
University Project â€“ Fall 2023
ðŸ”§ Project Overview
This project is part of the Computer Architecture course and focuses on implementing a simplified RISC-V processor. The objective is to understand and apply core architectural concepts such as the instruction fetch-decode-execute cycle, pipelining, and control logic by building a working processor model.

ðŸ§  Key Concepts Covered
RISC-V ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)

Instruction decoding

ALU operations

Register file and memory interfacing

Pipelining (optional stages depending on implementation)

Control unit design (hardwired or microprogrammed)
